The game consists of a tank battle on a selected or randomly generated map, the player controls his own vehicle and his goal is to survive as long as possible on the battlefield and destroy as many opponents as possible. Thus achieving the highest number of points at the end of the summary. The game also contains various bonuses hidden in boxes, for example: bonus to HP, damage, tank speed or mines.
